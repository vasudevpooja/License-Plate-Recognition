# License-Plate-Recognition
The ANPR (Automatic Number plate Recognition) system is based on image processing technology. 
The main objective here is to design an efficient and automatic vehicle identification system by using the vehicle's license plate.The system ahould first capture the vehicle's license plate image. The captured images are then extracted, Optical character recognition is used to identify the characters. The obtained data is then compared with the data stored in the database. The system is implemented and simulated on MATLAB and performance is tested on real images.
